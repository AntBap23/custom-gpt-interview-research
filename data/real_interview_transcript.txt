Persona 17: I've been working in this program for 2 years. So since April of

and my main role now is is coordinating and managing up and go, which is

14
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.040
Persona 17: the online platform that a lot of the cooperatives we support use to sell their services.

15
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.350
Mehmet Yetim: So yeah, that's my brief introduction

16
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.010
Mehmet Yetim: in terms of rawls.

17
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.380
Persona 17: Yes, you mean for our program or for the cooperatives.

18
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:12.740
Persona 17: I can get both. Yeah. there's our program, and our organization is a center for family life. The whole social Services organization is a nonprofit.

19
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:23.830
Persona 17: So 5 0 1 3, c. Nonprofit. and the businesses we support our private entity so the co-ops that we help form our llc

20
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.760
Persona 17: private businesses

21
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:38.400
and we're kind of just in. We don't have any legal relationship to the cooperatives. We're just in the we sign mo use with them like an agreement of services we provide and support we provide to the businesses.

22
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:52.710
Persona 17: But our program is really just providing technical assistance and guidance to these businesses. But the businesses are their own entities, and the workers are also owners, and they're the ones who run the businesses and make all the decisions about them.

23
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.160
Persona 17: So yeah, the co-ops themselves are our Llcs.

24
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.130
Mehmet Yetim: Okay?

25
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.040
Persona 17: And then do you guys who like

26
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.780
Mehmet Yetim: maybe the managers, or like me and Ceos? Or how does the the structure?

27
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.850
Persona 17: Yeah. So

28
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:24.570
Persona 17: cooperatives. The way cooperatives are structured is usually there's Well, yeah, there are several different types of cooperatives, but the ones we support. All of the members have an equal share of the business. So.

29
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:37.950
Persona 17: for example, if it's cooperative of 7 worker owners, all of the workers are also co-owners of the business, there's no hierarchy. 
They all vote collectively on any business decision. and in terms of like governance and running the business. They have different roles, so usually they have like committees. So some will be in charge of marketing, Others will do coordinate the finances and the co-ops also sometimes hire external consultants to help with some aspects of managing the business. So, for example, most of the cooperatives we support pay a bookkeeper to do their like payroll and manage their finances.

32
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:19.260
Persona 17: And that's something that also is decided among the members. They decide how much of their payment, how much money they want to leave in the co-OP to use for like administrative purposes and to cover business costs.

33
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.390
so

34
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:37.140
Persona 17: most of them they'll keep about 85 of their earnings, and then they'll leave 15 in the business to kind of help operate and run the business. But yeah, in terms of there's no like bosses. There's no manager. It's it's all of the people in the cooperative, collectively running it.

35
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.810
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's great. And then in terms of their like.

36
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.290
Mehmet Yetim: If you want to call in to say capital when they build a business like, how do they get that money?

37
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.710
Yeah. So

38
00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:03.100
Persona 17: they all invest in the cooperative. They depending on the co-OP. They have different kind of like an investment costs, and they'll put in some money into the business when they join.

39
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:19.980
Persona 17: and then, if they ever leave the cooperative that money they get that investment back. So it's it's an investment that they put in, and that's separate from the money that they the money that they take out of their paycheck. That's just money that goes to the business, and it's used. That's not an investment.

40
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.690
and that's separate from money that they invest that they then get back if they leave the business. So there's kind of like 2 separate pools of money.

41
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:47.130
Persona 17: Okay, yeah, that's very interesting.

42
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:56.850
Persona 17: Cover the cost of their like training. We help them sometimes by their insurance and some of like those initial costs that they need to get the business running.

43
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.450
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's yeah, okay, that's it.

44
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.940
Mehmet Yetim: Interesting

45
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:12.590
Mehmet Yetim: right to look at it. So Are there any instances, For example, some members They have more investments, or, like some of them, they have less in terms of having their power in the organization.

46
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:23.020
Persona 17: No, not in, not in the co-ops that we support, and usually the way co-ops are structured is that there's equal shares of everyone

47
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:35.020
Persona 17: that are in the business. So yeah, so all of the workers contribute the same amount when they join the business, and they all have an equal equal vote and equal share in the business.

48
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.890
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's

49
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:48.090
Mehmet Yetim: cool. And so just one of the after questions that I wrote here. So it's just so. Opinion: question. So what do you think? How do you describe the benefits of like

50
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.760
Mehmet Yetim: starting like business as a call?

51
00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:00.120
Persona 17: Yeah. there are many, I think we really believe in this model because

52
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:15.800
Persona 17: a it it empowers people to have power and decision and their businesses to choose their own prices, to choose their own schedule, to work collaboratively and help kind of like build this movement of

53
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:25.850
Persona 17: non-hierarchical workplaces and workplaces that are really centered around, like you know. more humanistic values I would say.

54
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:40.220
Persona 17: and also most of the communities we support are immigrant Spanish speaking women who are kind of like, locked out of a lot of work opportunities in the Us. Because of so many structural barriers that they face.

55
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.160
Persona 17: So.

56
00:07:42.450 --> 00:08:01.310
Persona 17: being a coner in a in a cooperative business, is an opportunity for them to earn a living wage to also own a business without needing documentation or other resources, they might not have access to. So it's just like, yeah, it's. It's a really valuable tool for people who are kind of locked out of the traditional

57
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.990
work

58
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.360
Persona 17: market

59
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.720
Persona 17: to have to have an opportunity to

60
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.700
Persona 17: support themselves.

61
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.640
Persona 17: Yeah.

62
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.900
Mehmet Yetim: Great.

63
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.100
Mehmet Yetim: And then. So that's some.

64
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.720
Mehmet Yetim: and form up questions about like decision making. So in in general, how do you

65
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.110
Mehmet Yetim: It's Grabbed your decision making process?

66
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:42.690
Persona 17: Yeah. So usually. And again, we, this is where we kind of help facilitate the process. So a lot of times you'll be in the meetings with them, and we'll help like, Bring a proposal, or we'll help guide the conversation when members are making a decision.

67
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:49.050
Usually when something needs to be decided related to the business. Theyâ€™ll bring it up in a meeting and discuss it. And there's like always space for discussion for people to express their different opinions, and how they feel. And then at some point there's a formal vote. So again, a lot of times. That's where we'll help facilitate the process and be like, okay. Here's a proposal based on what we're hearing in the group. or based on recommendations. You know that that we've heard that would be good for you all to employ in your business. And at that point the all of the worker owners vote.

70
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:30.540
Persona 17: and they have different rules and their co-ops different agreements on like what percentage needs to approve something in order for it to pass. And sometimes it depends on the type of decision.

71
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:37.050
Persona 17: But yeah, basically everyone votes. And if the right percentage of people are in agreement, then

72
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.060
Persona 17: whatever the decision is would be passed and implemented.

73
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:54.040
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's great. So I have one. Then question their follow up. So I heard that you said It may like the day rewarding style, or maybe the

74
00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:02.520
Mehmet Yetim: maybe how what percentage is needed, maybe depending on the position that needs to be made so.

75
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:11.500
Mehmet Yetim: or me to categorize like what kind of decisions they make, and then what kind of structure they may need for those can you identify elaborate on that more?

76
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:26.890
Persona 17: Yeah. So usually, though in their manuals they'll describe the types of of decision that might require, like a super majority. So, for example, if most decisions just require a majority, more than 50% are in agreement

77
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:40.610
Persona 17: for everyday decisions that may not not have as much impact on the business, and then they might describe like, okay for more important decisions, that, and they all define these differently. But it could be like decisions that impact

78
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:55.610
Persona 17: that could impact like revenue for the business that could involve like changing the business name, or where they offer services, or to accept or get rid of a member right to like expel a member from the Cooperative

79
00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:10.730
Persona 17: or to decide to grow the cooperative. All of those are our big business decisions, so usually they'll have some sort of like outline of like. These are the types of decisions that we require a super majority for, and that could be like 75% in approval, for example.

80
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:18.780
Persona 17: And yeah, that depends. Each cooperative does that differently and has different decisions that they consider need

81
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.390
Persona 17: more people in approval.

82
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.260
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, great. So

83
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:36.790
Mehmet Yetim: couple of questions here. So just one thing before I forget. So the what would make a cooperative to the sides or forward for to expel a number

84
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.380
Persona 17: again. That

85
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.230
Persona 17: is, it varies a little in each cooperative. They they decide that internally usually.

86
00:11:47.630 --> 00:12:03.850
Persona 17: But, for example. we had a case recently where there was one member who for like 3 months wasn't accepting any jobs. And they were just kind of like inactive. And so when, since they weren't accepting jobs. They also weren't, contributing financially to the cooperative. And at that point the members discussed it and made the decision that that person couldn't be in the cooperative anymore, if they weren't going to be contributing. So that's an example. It could be like if you're not contributing your your fees to the Co-OP.

88
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:32.940
Or if, for example, there's been problems in like your the service that that member is providing and it's affecting the image of the business, most of the crops we support right now we're in the cleaning industry, so they provide like domestic services.

89
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:40.610
Persona 17: So maybe if they're getting a lot of complaints from clients that could be something that could prompt the co-OP to

90
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.630
have a conversation about expelling a member.

91
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.370
Persona 17: and then obviously anything that's like

92
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:58.220
Persona 17: anything the members doing that's like unethical if they were causing problems in the co-OP. Or. yeah. you know, you can imagine situations where

93
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:07.620
Persona 17: maybe something is happening that would have caused the group to want to vote someone out. But yeah, we haven't had any extreme examples like that.

94
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.710
Persona 17: Yeah.

95
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.930
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, Great. Yeah. Thank you so much that those are great examples, and I like examples because they are more like

96
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:29.000
Mehmet Yetim: Yes, I will be happy if I get more examples. Great. Thank you so much. I know you all right. Great knowledge on that area. So

97
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:38.420
Mehmet Yetim: I appreciate that. So just it's it doesn't have to be very relevant. But just make sure that I completely got this process.

98
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.190
Mehmet Yetim: So when I try it when they try to expel a member.

99
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.600
Mehmet Yetim: so that's member

100
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.090
Mehmet Yetim: possibly will not be watching in, or will not be joined in that meeting right? So

101
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.840
they could. And again.

102
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.110
Persona 17: I think

103
00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:04.030
Persona 17: it's kind of case by case, and it would be up to the coop members to decide. I think that member could be present and could be part of the conversation.

104
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:16.090
Persona 17: But yeah, i'm not. I haven't like, been present for many of those conversations in the past. I'm not sure how they've because i'm a little more macro. I'm more managing like the platform and the administration.

105
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:28.570
Persona 17: But yeah, usually it would be one of us like someone on our team kind of facilitating and saying, okay, we've been noticing this like. Do you all want to discuss this and discuss how to proceed with the member.

106
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:40.660
Persona 17: Sometimes they might also decide to give them like a trial period or something right to say like, okay, we? We're noticing this problem with clients.

107
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.580
Persona 17: Do you need our? How can we support you to like fix this this problem? If you do want to stay in the Co. OP.

108
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:59.880
Persona 17: And maybe it can be like taking extra trainings, or you know. Yeah, whatever they whatever they need in order to improve their performance. And at that point, if they give them like a time period and they see improvement, they might decide to.

109
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.980
Persona 17: They can stay.

110
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:09.850
Persona 17: Yeah. So I would imagine it would probably make more sense for the conversation to happen without the member in question present.

111
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.110
But yeah, we haven't had too many situations where

112
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.900
Persona 17: that's happened. So far.

113
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.830
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, great. Thank you so much. And so one more do you have.

114
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.020
Mehmet Yetim: for example, an example for

115
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.170
Mehmet Yetim: like one for

116
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:33.130
Mehmet Yetim: important decision that you say like require maybe someone to 80% of what?

117
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:53.680
Persona 17: Yeah, I guess recently we and this is kind of an example I gave earlier. But recently the several of the cooperatives. The cleaning cooperatives decided that they want to grow. They want to invite new members. which would mean, you know, they they would do like an open house. They would invite people to come, learn about the cooperative. Then they would invite people to apply and join their business, and there'd be like a training process that they would have to do with the new members to kind of like, integrate them, and teach them how to be part of the Co-OP.

119
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:23.130
Persona 17: So, before starting that whole process, the cooperatives had to decide how to vote, to decide. Yes, we want to like start this process. We want to welcome new people to the cooperative.

120
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:32.220
Persona 17: So that's the type of decision that would require. and most cooperative to super majority. So it'd require, like most of the members to be on board with

121
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.740
welcoming new people into the business.

122
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.090
Persona 17: Yeah.

123
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.660
Persona 17: Are there any like during the decision making process? Are there any discussions on going?

124
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.260
Mehmet Yetim: What will be that? Like the typical meeting?

125
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.910
Yeah. I guess

126
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:59.700
Persona 17: a recent example that I was more directly involved in, Not as recent now, I guess, but with the vaccination with Covid vaccinations. We were starting to notice that a lot of

127
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:11.750
Persona 17: this was in right. After the vaccine came out, or recently after the vaccine came out. We were noticing that a lot of businesses, a lot of the competition, cleaning businesses, or other people offering services were, including that they were vaccinated on their websites, and that was like a an important for clients to know that people that are, you know, coming to their homes and offering a service are vaccinated. So at that point we brought it to the Cooperative to cleaning cooperatives. And we said, like, you know, our recommendation is that you all think about having a vaccine requirement, because it, you know, it will affect your business, and most of the competition is saying that they're vaccinated, and it would be like an important step for the business. And so then there was a period of discussion, and the co-ops there were some members who were against it for like health reasons or religious reasons, and there was like a lot of back and forth conversations, meetings that were had where members would express their different points of view. And eventually we did come to a decision, and it was approved by the majority, and there were a few members who didn't want to get vaccinated who had to actually leave the cooperative because they collectively decided that they did think it was important to require vaccines. But yeah, I guess that's an example where there was like several meetings actually of discussion before members were able to decide.

136
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:49.740
Persona 17: And then they made some exceptions to. At first they were like, okay, maybe we'll. We'll require vaccinations. But with certain exceptions, for, like, you know, if someone can't get a vaccine for a health reason or religious reason, maybe you will make an exception for them.

137
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.940
Persona 17: So yeah, there are always a lot of factors to consider, and there's a lot of like discussion, and it it can take a while to make decisions. I think that's like one of the downsides of a coop like of course when there isn't one boss just deciding, and everyone has to be involved in the process that can make it more difficult to move things forward.

140
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:18.960
Mehmet Yetim: Yeah, that was one of the things that came to my mind. You were talking about the vaccination. I was like. if I am not like

141
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:28.410
Mehmet Yetim: agreeing with this decision in the beginning that it like it's Probably people can't make me agreed in in the next couple of hours, like I need more time.

142
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.750
Persona 17: and sometimes it sometimes that does happen sometimes

143
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:44.670
Persona 17: in the process of having the conversation and hearing people's perspective. Some members start to change their perspective, and I think that's like that's part of the process is like having those conversations and

144
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.150
Persona 17: having people express why they feel the way they do.

145
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.580
Persona 17: but not always. Sometimes there are strong opinions that

146
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.790
Persona 17: remain

147
00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:03.310
Mehmet Yetim: okay, and that's even make me feel like they might be empathetic in terms of like they hear other people's opinion than they may

148
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.320
Mehmet Yetim: change your opinion. That's an interesting aspect.

149
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:14.050
Persona 17: Yeah. yeah. And it's interesting to think of a business as also like a social group in that way, like there are.

150
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:21.060
Persona 17: They're always conflict. There's always complicated group dynamics, but that's like part of  being in a business where you're all working collaboratively. And that's part of what I think is like, really like unique and beautiful about the model, too.

152
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.170
Mehmet Yetim: Hmm.

153
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.430
Mehmet Yetim: So then, the one that one of my follow up questions was that like, how are the conflicts result overall.

154
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.940
Persona 17: Yeah.

155
00:20:45.640 --> 00:21:01.310
Persona 17: that again is something where, like our team will sometimes guide the process like and not me specifically as much anymore. Because, like I said, I'm, a little removed from working directly from the co-ops. But if we're noticing that there's conflict like that, a lot of members are

156
00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.320
Persona 17: that some members are like upset at other members in the group, or there's like a recurring problem.

157
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:24.340
Persona 17: Usually the approach is to create space to address it and talk about it. So we'll bring that to a meeting and say, like, you know, we're noticing that this is happening that there's conflict for this reason, and just create space for people to like, talk about it and express like what's wrong, what they need to change and to see like what kind of agreement they can come to, or what steps we can take to resolve the conflict. and also normalizing that, like conflict, is, is normal and healthy. It's part of the process. So I think a lot of it is trying not to shy away from it, and like talking about it openly and finding ways to resolve it in the group. Yeah, and that's easier said than done. But usually the approach is to kind of like, create space to address it openly.

161
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.900
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, Great? Yes.

162
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.230
Mehmet Yetim: that that that that's correct. I agree with that.

163
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.510
Persona 17: Yeah.

164
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.470
Mehmet Yetim: So i'll go a little bit to my central point that, like, were there any

165
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:23.230
Mehmet Yetim: examples when one of the startups. We're not able to deliver the like anticipated outcomes that they have like. They plan something.

166
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.500
Mehmet Yetim: or they plan on customer or something else. And then thanks for not going. Well.

167
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:46.520
Persona 17: Yeah, I don't know if I exactly understand the question like you mean in terms of the service that they're offering to the customer like not being able to deliver it correctly.

168
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.840
Mehmet Yetim: Yes.

169
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.110
Persona 17: okay.

170
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.550
yeah. I think there are definitely a few.

171
00:22:54.130 --> 00:23:04.220
Persona 17: The cases where there's been problems with delivering the service and complaints from customers like one thing that comes to mind is. it can be difficult, in this kind of structure, a lot of a lot of standardization in terms of the service, because the whole idea of the coop is to create flexibility, and to give the workers power to kind of set their own requirements and schedules and decide how they run things. But when weâ€™re offering things through a website that's branded, and we're trying to deliver like a consistent product to customers that can be difficult. So, I think one complaint we get sometimes is that every workers service is a little different in terms of how they clean, how long they take. So, for example, if one of the worker owners has a recurring client, and they go to this client, every week to clean their house, for example. And then someone else in the cooperative covers for them one week because they're not available a lot of times. We'll get complaints from the client saying like, oh, the service was different this time, or it took longer, or they didn't clean like the windows the way I wanted to, or whatever. So I think we see that a lot like each person in the co-OP kind of has their own style, their own approach. and that can make it difficult to maintain like a

176
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:35.040
Persona 17: a brand image right, and to really feel like we can like, scale the brand and deliver a consistent service every time, I think, with a lot of these like bigger companies, everything is very standardized, and it's like, okay, You follow these rules. You do this checklist and it's kind of difficult.

177
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:43.860
Persona 17: more difficult to establish that within a co-OP, because members aren't as like driven to to establish those kinds of like strict standards for themselves?
Mehmet: And so what? How did you guys, for example, overcome. Or if you guys overcome this challenge like,

178
00:24:46.550 --> 00:25:04.680
Persona 17: That's [standardizing the quality] actually an ongoing challenge. I don't think we've we've done some things to try to address it. So, for example, we've we've brought this concern to members and said like we know we've gotten these complaints from clients in order to like improve your business and get more clients. It'd be important to standardize some aspects. And so we have over time standardized some aspects of the cleaning. And, for example. we created kind of like a a guide of like a checklist of like, okay, these are the things that everyone should do, and in each cleaning and members voted to implement that and use that. But it's still difficult, more difficult in practice.

182
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.290
And I think we still have challenges with that. Yeah.

183
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.480
Mehmet Yetim: okay, that's very interesting. And then

184
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:50.270
Mehmet Yetim: so are there any like instances where members they need to make decisions when they like to their daily work there.

185
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.770
Mehmet Yetim: so they can change the process.

186
00:25:53.230 --> 00:26:05.410
Persona 17: Yeah, so they can. They have like a pricing structure. That's it has ranges for each home size. But when a when a a worker arrives at the

187
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:24.160
Persona 17: At the whatever space that they're cleaning, they do a walk through, and they can edit the price they can choose within the range, or they can even like, increase it a little, based on what they see in the moment. And again, this is to give them like power, and to for them to be able to like. Set a price that's fair for the service they're delivering and it's like the 2, the double edge sort of that sort of flexibility right where it's like the balance between giving the worker power to like, set their price and be flexible in the moment; while also, having, like a consistent and standardized way of doing pricing and other things for the client. So yeah, members, when they arrive they can adjust the price.

190
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:57.840
Persona 17: And that's the main thing that they can really like change in the moment at the job, and then they can also negotiate with the client with the client if they want like.

191
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:14.520
Persona 17: If the client wants some things cleaned or others not, or the client doesn't want to pay as much. Maybe they'll say, okay, we can clean just the common areas, but not the bedrooms. So they do. I think there is a little more flexibility than like a traditional cleaning service. Maybe

192
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.470
Mehmet Yetim: Okay. So okay. So then they.

193
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.370
Mehmet Yetim: the member has like some flexibility to decide

194
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.350
Mehmet Yetim: how much it how much money takes to like

195
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.200
Persona 17: in the area.

196
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.310
Persona 17: Yeah, it does.

197
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.340
Mehmet Yetim: That's interesting. Yeah, that's

198
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:49.690
Persona 17: and that's part of yeah, the challenge as well, because also members might have different ideas of how to price. And it's hard to standardize that. So, one member might say like, yeah, i'll do this for a $100. And another member might see the same space and say, like to me, this is a $150. So, it's difficult to standardize like. Okay, how exactly are we choosing the price like what exactly is included, and what would constitute or justify a price increase. And that's something that I think we're continually working on, but is a little difficult.

201
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:17.100
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, yeah, that's like, maybe concerned about what? Reflect 2 different member group goes to the client

202
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:24.500
Mehmet Yetim: at the at different times, and I give you different price. Then how could this be explained to the clients.

203
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:40.580
Persona 17: Yeah, so that's a great point, because that's actually one of the steps that we took to try to avoid that problem. So with recurring clients. If one of if a one member is covering for another member, so they go to their job instead of them.

204
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:48.760
Persona 17: They have to keep the price consistent unless they're actually like changing the service. So that is something that

205
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:56.560
Persona 17: that the co-ops agreed on so at least in that case we're avoiding like one client getting different prices from 2 different

206
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.000
Persona 17: members.

207
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.650
Mehmet Yetim: Okay.

208
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.840
Mehmet Yetim: yeah.

209
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.850
Mehmet Yetim: when there is not a consistency

210
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.690
Mehmet Yetim: like in previous examples. How did you guys like communicate this with the clients.

211
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.930
Persona 17: Usually

212
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:22.460
Persona 17: the office will explain like what the members reasoning was like for

213
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.050
Persona 17: anytime. There's a price increase at the or a price change

214
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:37.040
Persona 17: that the client doesn't agree with. We'll just talk to the member and ask the member what were the factors that cause them to increase the price, and we'll say we'll explain it to the client

215
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:50.600
Persona 17: like oh, they justify this price increase because I don't know. Maybe your home hadn't been cleaned in a while, and it needed extra attention, or they were cleaning an extra room or whatever it is.

216
00:29:52.930 --> 00:30:06.650
Persona 17: Yeah, and so that's but again, we haven't really needed to explain, like we've kept price consistent for customers that are recurring, even if a different member goes. So that hasn't been an issue as much. But clients will sometimes just ask like.

217
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:14.990
Persona 17: how did they arrive at this price? And at that point we'll have to like. Give them a little more of like an explanation and a breakdown.

218
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:22.360
Persona 17: and it doesn't come from us. It comes from the members. So we're just kind of like mediating between the client and the the worker. Owners.

219
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.530
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, great. Thank you so much.

220
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.170
Persona 17: Yeah. And one

221
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.820
Mehmet Yetim: here one question. Are there any like

222
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.930
Persona 17: is she making? I think we were mentioning something like committees or something? And it

223
00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.910
Mehmet Yetim: any places, or any

224
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.810
Mehmet Yetim: a formation of the bad

225
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.240
Mehmet Yetim: specific members they come together and need need to make decisions.

226
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.110
Persona 17: Yeah.

227
00:30:52.270 --> 00:31:09.460
Persona 17: So usually the coop will have meetings every now and then. That's like the whole coop. And so that's where they'll meet and they can make decisions like that means everyone involved, but They also have meetings for each committee. So, for example, the Finance Committee will meet to coordinate like payments for that month, or to check expenses. or the Marketing Committee will meet to plan like a marketing event like oh, they're we're planning to go and like hand out flyers at the Park, and so they'll meet to coordinate that and plan it. So yeah, there are spaces where each individual committee meets, and there are some decisions that maybe Don't need full group approval, and they can just be coordinated within the committees. And usually the co-ops also like, describe that in their they have membership manuals, which is basically like the guiding

230
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:49.880
Persona 17: legal agreement and document for their co-ops. So that's where they'll decide like. Okay.

231
00:31:50.200 --> 00:32:00.190
Persona 17: you know we have these committees and these types of decisions are made within the committees, and so some maybe don't need to be brought to the whole group for discussion.

232
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.570
Mehmet Yetim: And now are there any.

233
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:09.870
Mehmet Yetim: for example, the core values when they like different committees, they make position on behalf of the rest of the call.

234
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.720
Persona 17: Are there Core values

235
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:19.670
Mehmet Yetim: this or anything that you like. Say they're representing the majority.

236
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:31.150
Persona 17: Yeah, definitely. So each coop has as part of this same document. They collectively decide on their mission as a business. Their core values. Yeah, they decide on like some core kind of like tenants and and guidelines. Yeah. So that guides all of their decisions.

238
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:55.300
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, yeah, just was curious like how we can make sure that rather than the Finance Committee is making decision on behalf of the Co-OP, but the decision is for the benefit of everyone in the call. Not only the people

239
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.380
Mehmet Yetim: who are in the Finance Committee.

240
00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:09.110
Persona 17: Yeah, yeah. And I would say it's not as often the committees are making decisions. Usually the committee work is more like actually like carrying out activities. So, for example, like every month, the

241
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:16.940
Persona 17: cooperative members have to receive their share of, however, however many, however much work they did, however many jobs they received.

242
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:29.450
Persona 17: so the Finance Committee might meet just to like. distribute the payments and make those transfers, so usually that I would say the committees are meeting more to like, do administrative work for the co-OP

243
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.910
Persona 17: and not as much like make big decisions. I think usually the decision making is done in the whole group.

244
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:37.990
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's

245
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.230
Mehmet Yetim: interesting. Nice to hear. And

246
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:49.010
Mehmet Yetim: are there any? So i'm not sure if this is completely relevant. But are there any

247
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.030
Mehmet Yetim: mechanism sort of anyways that these cops

248
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.120
Mehmet Yetim: make sure or monitor the risks related to their business?

249
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:18.800
Persona 17: Not exactly. I think we right now we do a lot of that like us in in our supporting role as an organization. We're the ones that will generate reports on like how sales are going.

250
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.949
Persona 17: Maybe

251
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:39.290
Persona 17: we'll notice, like you know, an issue with pricing or something. So I think, in our role as kind of like almost consultants to the co-OP. We do some of that, like more Macro, like looking at the data looking at sales, looking at the competition and and where their pricing is in comparison to the competition.

252
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:50.920
Persona 17: So we bring in some more of that kind of like Macro strategy. It's not as much, not as much in the individual businesses that they're actually tracking those things.

253
00:34:51.040 --> 00:35:01.460
Persona 17: but they could in the future, and they could They could have. They could assign that role to a few members of the Cooperative, or they could hire someone to help guide them.

254
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:16.650
Persona 17: But again, I think, like. I think, part of the reason that we've stuck to the cleaning industry, and we've been pretty successful with supporting co-ops in that industry. Is that it's always in demand

255
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:21.630
Persona 17: and it's. It's a it there's a large market for it. And in New York City, especially like

256
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:29.280
Persona 17: there's plenty of people with wealth that want to get their homes cleaned regularly, so we haven't run into as many.

257
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.020
Persona 17: too many issues with like not having enough of a market for it.

258
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.850
Persona 17: Luckily, yeah.

259
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.210
Mehmet Yetim: that's great. Yeah.

260
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:49.360
Mehmet Yetim: New York has a lot of approaches. So I did. My masters in New York and my university. Yeah, it's a beautiful place.

261
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:54.600
Persona 17: I I I lived in Brooklyn. Yeah, I live in Brooklyn now. So.

262
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.790
Persona 17: Yeah.

263
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.720
Mehmet Yetim: a couple more questions.

264
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.520
Mehmet Yetim: Then. I don't make you so tired. Thank you for your time. So we were talking about for

265
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.930
Mehmet Yetim: it rising committee or advising people

266
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:20.070
Mehmet Yetim: they may hire like, but not be like you. It was just mentioned, and then it's gone. So can you?

267
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:33.860
Persona 17: Yeah, yeah. None of the co-ops right now have hired anyone to do like general strategic advising again. I think that's kind of our role, and

268
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:47.760
Persona 17: we offer services for free to the cooperative. So we we're there to provide technical assistance. We offer several years of support, as the cooperatives are up getting running. And

269
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.320
Persona 17: yeah kind of like building a customer base. And so yeah, that's

270
00:36:52.390 --> 00:37:01.170
Persona 17: I think that's part of the reason that these co-ops are like in many cases able to be successful is that they have like our free support

271
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:10.260
as just like a community based organization that does this work. And there are several organizations that do co-OP development. In the us. It's kind of like a growing movement.

272
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.540
Persona 17: Yeah. So

273
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.140
Persona 17: as of now, the co-ops usually the only kind of outside

274
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:26.910
Persona 17: people that they hire are bookkeepers like, I said, because that's one area where, like we, Don't, necessarily have financial expertise.

275
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:41.330
Persona 17: and usually members do need some support with managing the books and the finances of their co-ops, so they usually hire a bookkeeper, and I would say, that's and they they buy insurance. And I would say those are kind of the big like external

276
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:58.700
Persona 17: expenses that they have. But yeah, like I said as they as we cause we usually after. I would say around 5 years, we kind of like ease out our support and the ideas for these crops to be like sustainable and independent long term, and some of them have already

277
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.240
Persona 17: began to be more independent from us.

278
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:13.040
Persona 17: The idea is that then, yeah, they would. They would be, you know, on their own, and they would be able to manage their own finances and make decisions about if they wanted to hire someone

279
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.480
Persona 17: for example, to. I don't know

280
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:25.370
Persona 17: to manage the co-OP in a more strategic way, or to manage more of the Admin. So that the individual workers don't have to do as much of the administrative work.

281
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.400
Mehmet Yetim: Okay.

282
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.290
Mehmet Yetim: cool. And then

283
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.260
Mehmet Yetim: one of the last questions. So

284
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:37.400
Mehmet Yetim: in terms of planning, so like, how how do they plan, and how far? And then

285
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.100
Mehmet Yetim: today plan ahead

286
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.080
Persona 17: a little? I think there are different, and I might get to.

287
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.120
Persona 17: I don't want to get to and Louise with the government and stuff. But

288
00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:01.330
Persona 17: in terms of planning for, like the financial future of the cooperatives, for example, and like long term sustainability.

289
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:10.520
Persona 17: Like I said, several of these smaller cleaning businesses, they all use this website up and go to sell their services, and

290
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:25.690
Persona 17: that website, and is also a cooperative. So that booking platform is collectively like governed by the multiple businesses that use it, and they all set pricing together, and they like set some of the standards for the website together

291

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:46.150
Interviewee 17: and up and go. The collective has a board of directors that has representatives from the cooperatives, and it also has a few external seats of just people who have, like knowledge, business knowledge, or knowledge about the industry. So, I would say that governance body is where we think more strategically about like the financial future of ***[firm name], because right now it still has a lot of external funding. So, thinking about like, how can we make it sustainable long term? How can we grow our sales? What does marketing strategy look like so all of those kind of like bigger picture. 
Long-term strategic decisions happen, I would say, within the board with input, from the co-ops. So, like anytime, even the board makes a decision. There are representatives there from the businesses, and we a lot of times get input from all of the members of the cooperative. So we try to even have like that decision making be pretty democratic, like more of a representative democracy. So that's kind of where those bigger decisions happen.





296
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.050
Mehmet Yetim: Okay? And then this up and go. So it's like a alliance between.

297
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:52.080
Persona 17: Yeah, yeah. So up and go itself is a is a platform cooperative. So up and go is also a private entity. It's an Llc. And it's it's owned collectively owned by several cooperative businesses.

298
00:40:52.080 --> 00:41:04.780
So right now there are 6 cleaning businesses that are cooperative that we support, and they all use this central platform up and go. They all sell their services through up and go, and they collectively own it as well.

299
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.880
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's

300
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:18.640
Persona 17: yeah. So it's like the same structure as a cooperative. But instead of the members being individual people. The members are businesses.

301
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:25.320
Mehmet Yetim: and just couple of more questions there. How about the representatives to up and go like? How

302
00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.030
Mehmet Yetim: How are they

303
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:38.060
Mehmet Yetim: how they are? They selected from cooperatives who becomes the representative? Yeah. 

304
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:46.630
Persona 17: So, the people, who in the cooperatives, who are interested, they basically apply [for being a representative]. They say, Iâ€™m interested. This is why this is like the knowledge that I have and the expertise that I bring. There are so many different bodies. I don't want to confuse you, but there's also a membership committee that's just like a committee that has representatives from each of the cooperatives. So, and that's a group that I kind of help, facilitate and plan the meetings for. And so, in that space they would basically have elections and choose who they want to send to the board. So, it's the members themselves who are electing and choosing. Okay, let's send these representatives to the Board to make these decisions.

308
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.770
Persona 17: Okay.

309
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.570
Mehmet Yetim: our

310
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:36.350
Persona 17: everyone in the organization, a member of membership committee in this case

311
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:53.170
Persona 17: people in the membership committee. And so that's that also functions like a representative democracy, right where they, we make decisions about *** [firm name] the platform as a whole, and each cooperative has a vote through the representatives that they send.

312
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.130
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's

313
00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:01.260
Persona 17: very interesting. Yeah. hmm.

314
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:06.570
Persona 17: And I know it's a lot to digest.

315
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.920
Persona 17: And I even like I have like a.

316
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.410
and

317
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:17.120
Persona 17: it might help. I have just like a a visual of the structure. If you want to see

318
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.560
Mehmet Yetim: that would be great.

319
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.640
Persona 17: Yeah. So i'll show you.

320
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:27.000
Mehmet Yetim: Did you share the screen? Oh, yeah, I think you need to enable share screen share.

321
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.120
Persona 17: Okay.

322
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.940
Persona 17: So it's in Spanish. But

323
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:44.960
Persona 17: so this is like the structure of up and go right. So each of these are cooperative. So we have Brightly is kind of like a cooperative franchise. So all of these cooperatives share a brand.

324
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:55.150
Persona 17: But they're all different separate entities and businesses. So we have Brightly, Port Richmond, brightly Tribeca, brightly carol gardens. These are all just based in different parts of New York City.

325
00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:01.680
and then Apple echo cleaning, which is not a brightly. It's just a different cleaning cooperative. That's also part of up and go.

326
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:08.850
Persona 17: So these 6 6 businesses are co-owners of

327
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:17.240
Persona 17: the platform of up and go, and they collectively run it, and then we have these 2 governing bodies that I mentioned. We have the Board of Directors, which its role is like more macro strategic thinking and more like long term strategic thinking, and they have representatives from the cooperatives, and they have some external seats that are like people with expertise in the industry. And then we have the membership committee which their role is more like coordinating day to day operations, making decisions about pricing about like customer service policies about like, how do we adjust pricing? How do we? What should our home sizes look like so more day to day operations? And this committee has representatives from each of the 6 cooperatives

332
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:15.510
Persona 17: and then center for family life. Our organization basically just like facilitates and coordinates these governance structures. We help like prepare the agendas. We help coordinate the vote or like guide the voting process. But we don't actually have any like legal stakes. These are independent

333
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.270
Persona 17: entities.

334
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.640
Mehmet Yetim: Cool. That's great. And so the

335
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:32.480
Persona 17: this is the up, just to show you. I don't know if you looked at it. But this is what the website actually looks like. So this is up and go, and if i'm a client, I can just book

336
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.460
Persona 17: a cleaning. Normally.

337
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:40.210
Persona 17: this is where I would choose all the aspects of my cleaning, like my home size.

338
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:47.730
Persona 17: and once I book my cleaning, it would be assigned to one of the cooperatives. So

339
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:58.740
Persona 17: members use this platform, and it looks kind of like a traditional booking platform. But the jobs are assigned to the the cooperative businesses that use up and go.

340
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.900
Mehmet Yetim: and we don't know which call partners will be assigned to the job.

341
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:20.740
Persona 17: No. So as a client you don't know, unless you specifically, unless you do know about the cooperatives. Maybe that's what brought you here because you like, are interested, or I don't know. And if you request a specific cooperative, then we can assign you one. But otherwise there's just like a rotation of cooperative. So we trade off assigning.

342
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.370
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, so it. And then in the back stage. So it's like.

343
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:29.160
Mehmet Yetim: hey? Everyone takes one customer, and

344
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.110
Persona 17: is it demand for call purchase.

345
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:33.510
Yeah.

346
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:48.200
Persona 17: basically it's a little more complicated because different cooperatives have different availability, too. So it depends. If a member is free on the day that that customer needs a cleaning. But basically we trade off between all the co-ops. Yeah.

347
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.730
Mehmet Yetim: okay. And then the

348
00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:58.280
Mehmet Yetim: Board of director members are not in the Member Committee. Right? So those are different people. That's why there is a coordination.

349
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:09.700
Mehmet Yetim: Okay? And then in your where it's. So how do you describe the difference between board of director members. And then.

350
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.750
Mehmet Yetim: yeah, the Board of Directors is

351
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:24.960
Persona 17: more again, more like Macro and thinking more about long-term strategy and sustainability of the platform.

352
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:32.860
Persona 17: So it kind of has like a I would say, like a broader lens, and also more expertise specifically in like

353
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.960
Persona 17: finances and marketing strategy.

354
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:51.920
So yeah, I I think a little more. Macro is like the best way I can describe it, whereas the membership committee is coordinating more like day to day operations that directly impact the worker owners. Which is why that's just like all comprised of of worker owners from the cooperatives.

355
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.120
So, for example, if they're saying like, oh, we think the price for

356
00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:14.920
Persona 17: 2 bedroom is too low. It should be higher. That's something that they would talk about in a membership committee, and they would decide to adjust that price. Or if they're like, oh, we're having this problem where sometimes we arrive at a client's house, and we can't reach the client, and they didn't leave us a key, and we should have like a policy, a cancellation policy

357
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:26.730
Persona 17: where we can charge clients if they're if we're not able to reach them. That's something. They would decide in the membership committee. So more like day to day operations, smaller scale decisions.

358
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.590
Mehmet Yetim: Okay. And then one more thing here. So then, in my

359
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.520
Mehmet Yetim: observation, the membership coming to me on demands.

360
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.130
Mehmet Yetim: and then board of Director meets periodically. Is it?

361
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:43.950
Persona 17: No, they actually both meet periodically. The membership committee meets every 3 weeks

362
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.550
just because it's important to have a space even just to like.

363
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:58.640
Persona 17: We usually have things to talk about and like policies to update and things like that. But even if we don't just to have a space where members can talk about what's been happening, if anything needs to be like looked at or addressed.

364
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:03.590
Persona 17: So we do meet every 3 weeks, and then the Board of Directors meets quarterly.

365
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:06.530
Mehmet Yetim: Okay, that's

366
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.740
Mehmet Yetim: very interesting. Thank you so much, for

367
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.690
Mehmet Yetim: like they're fine.

368
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:25.480
Mehmet Yetim: Sometimes. Having a visual is helpful. Yeah, in Spanish. But you get I got the concept there. So yeah.

369
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.700
Mehmet Yetim: Yeah.

370
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:36.490
Persona 17: after that I don't have anything for now in my mind. So that's like I asked you so many questions. I bombarded you with my questions.

371
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:44.530
Persona 17: Yeah, and I know there's a lot of information. But if you have any, follow up questions, feel free to email me, and i'd be interested to see what you end up

372
00:49:44.980 --> 00:50:00.690
Mehmet Yetim: publishing, if anything so feel free to share that as well

373
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.260
Mehmet Yetim: like. You have broad

374
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.300
Persona 17: information about this like style at this like concept. So it's.

375
00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:17.060
Mehmet Yetim: If i'm trying to draw a model like of this issue making, I can try to like, meet you and then ask your opinion. Okay, Does it look like correct out if there is any suggestions on that.

376
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:27.540
Mehmet Yetim: because when I meet organizations they have their own way, like I usually meet with organization cops, and they have their own way to describe things, but, like they only have one way right. But

377
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:31.140
Mehmet Yetim: based on your experience, actually, you are experiencing many different areas.

378
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:34.680
Persona 17: and I can see that it can be very useful. Yeah.

379
00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:46.790
Persona 17: Yeah, we're gonna yeah, I'm: happy to help in the future, If you need more.
